# bbch-maize-learning-curves
This documentation presents the learning curves and performance metrics for deep learning models employed in the automatic detection of maize developmental stages according to the BBCH scale. The repository contains curves for models trained on both RGB and multispectral images.
It is intended to accompany the article entitled "Detection and Classification of Maize Growth Stages in BBCH Scale Using Multispectral and RGB Images with Deep Neural Networks and Voting Classifier Approach".
